Shopping cart 
# Process
For this assignment, I created two Figma app screens to show the shopping experience of buying a coat on sale. I tried to make each screen look as realistic as possible. I included the sale advertisement, the item, the cost, and the sizes. Then, I created a counter for both screens so that the customer could go up or down on how many coats they want to purchase. It eventually settles on 1 item and shows the final price.

# Learnings
I had no idea how much detail goes into a shopping cart page. It was fun to learn how to create a counter on Figma and see it change numbers. It was a challenge at first to learn how, but after watching a video, I figured out how to do it. I think the counter overall makes the prototype look and feel more realistic.
